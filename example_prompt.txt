I need an advanced, personalized meal plan using the complete enhanced system capabilities:

NUTRITIONAL TARGETS:
- 2,200 calories daily
- 185g protein (for muscle building)
- 280g carbs (active lifestyle)
- 90g fat (hormone optimization)

DIETARY RESTRICTIONS & HEALTH GOALS:
- Gluten-free (celiac disease)
- Dairy-free (lactose intolerance)
- Tree nut allergy (severe - avoid all tree nuts and cross-contamination)
- Anti-inflammatory focus (omega-3 rich foods preferred)
- Whole foods only (no processed ingredients)
- Low FODMAP friendly where possible

LIFESTYLE & PREFERENCES:
- 6 recipes total: 3 main meals + 2 snacks + 1 flexible meal/smoothie
- Workout schedule: 6am strength training (Mon/Wed/Fri), 7am cardio (Tue/Thu)
- Cooking skill: Intermediate (comfortable with most techniques)
- Time constraints: Max 45 minutes weekdays, up to 90 minutes weekends
- Family context: Cooking for 2 adults, need to scale appropriately
- Budget: Moderate ($150-200/week grocery budget)

PERSONAL PREFERENCES (for learning/adaptation):
- Protein preferences: Love chicken and fish, neutral on beef, dislike organ meats
- Cuisine preferences: Mediterranean, Asian fusion, some Mexican
- Texture preferences: Enjoy variety, dislike mushy textures
- Flavor preferences: Moderate spice level, enjoy umami, avoid overly sweet
- Seasonal: Currently winter - prefer warming, comfort foods
- Cooking style: Enjoy batch cooking, meal prep, one-pan meals

COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS:
- Pre-workout nutrition: Need easily digestible carbs 1 hour before 6am workouts
- Post-workout nutrition: High protein + carbs within 30 minutes after training
- Evening meals: Higher fat, lower carbs for better sleep (no workout days)
- Weekend variety: More complex/interesting recipes when I have time
- Leftover optimization: Efficiently use ingredients across multiple recipes

CONSTRAINT CHALLENGES (test the conflict resolver):
- Need high protein but allergic to major protein sources (nuts)
- Want anti-inflammatory foods but also muscle-building macros
- Need quick prep but also want variety and complexity
- Budget constraints vs quality whole food requirements
- Family-friendly but specialized dietary restrictions

ADVANCED ORCHESTRATION REQUEST:
Please use the meal-plan-orchestrator to coordinate the FULL enhanced workflow:

PHASE 0 - INTELLIGENT PRE-PLANNING:
1. User preference analysis and learning initialization
2. Constraint feasibility validation and conflict resolution
3. Advanced macro optimization with workout timing integration
4. Comprehensive dietary restriction analysis with substitution intelligence

PHASE 1 - PERSONALIZED RECIPE DEVELOPMENT:
5. Generate 6 recipes with preference integration and macro precision
6. Multi-dimensional validation (taste, nutrition, feasibility, compliance)
7. Iterative refinement based on validation feedback
8. Recipe optimization with advanced mathematical algorithms

PHASE 2 - PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
9. Sophisticated portion optimization for exact macro targets
10. Advanced batch cooking plan with time/resource optimization
11. Comprehensive quality assurance review
12. Final meal plan formatting with implementation guide

LEARNING INTEGRATION:
- Initialize preference profile based on stated preferences
- Set up feedback mechanisms for future meal plan improvements
- Document baseline preferences for system learning

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Macro accuracy within 1% of targets
- All dietary restrictions perfectly satisfied
- Workout nutrition timing optimized
- Practical implementation feasible for stated lifestyle
- Budget constraints respected
- Family scaling requirements met
- Preference integration demonstrable in recipe selection

EXPECTED SOPHISTICATION:
This should demonstrate the full power of the enhanced system including:
- Advanced constraint resolution when requirements seem impossible
- Mathematical optimization for precise macro targeting
- Intelligent personalization based on preferences
- Robust error handling if any conflicts arise
- Production-quality meal plan with professional documentation

SPECIAL CHALLENGE:
If the system detects any impossible constraint combinations (which is likely given the complexity), I want to see the constraint-conflict-resolver in action, providing clear alternatives and trade-offs while maintaining as many requirements as possible.

Make this a showcase of the complete enhanced meal planning system capabilities!
