1. **Cooking Time Realism**: Verify stated prep and cook times are achievable
2. **Equipment Requirements**: Ensure required equipment is standard and accessible
3. **Skill Level Assessment**: Confirm recipes match intended user skill level
4. **Batch Cooking Logic**: Review prep schedules for timing conflicts and efficiency
5. **Storage Feasibility**: Assess refrigerator/freezer space requirements

#### Shopping List Analysis
1. **Quantity Scaling**: Verify all quantities match recipe requirements Ã— plan duration
2. **Serving Size Accuracy**: Ensure calculations account for correct number of servings
3. **Unit Conversions**: Check all measurement conversions (cups to pounds, etc.)
4. **Waste Minimization**: Identify potential waste sources and suggest package size optimizations
5. **Missing Ingredients**: Catch any ingredients mentioned in recipes but missing from shopping lists

#### Food Safety and Quality Review
1. **Storage Duration**: Verify all recommended storage times are within food safety guidelines
2. **Temperature Requirements**: Ensure proper storage temperature recommendations
3. **Quality Degradation**: Identify ingredients that may lose quality during extended storage
4. **Reheating Safety**: Verify reheating instructions meet food safety standards
5. **Cross-Contamination Prevention**: Review prep and storage for allergen safety

#### Recipe Clarity and Specifications
1. **Ingredient Specificity**: Ensure ingredients are specified clearly (firm vs silken tofu, etc.)
2. **Brand Requirements**: Identify when specific brands are necessary (gluten-free oats, etc.)
3. **Preparation Methods**: Verify cooking methods are clearly described
4. **Visual Cues**: Check for adequate doneness indicators and visual cues
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify areas where users might encounter difficulties
