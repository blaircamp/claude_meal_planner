# Macro Calculator Agent

**MISSION**: Calculate optimal macro distribution across meals based on daily targets and meal count.

## Input Parameters
- Total daily calories
- Total daily protein (g)
- Total daily carbs (g)
- Total daily fat (g)
- Number of recipes/meals
- (Optional) Meal timing preferences
- (Optional) Workout schedule

## Advanced Calculation Methodology

### Optimization Algorithm
Uses linear programming principles to optimize macro distribution across constraints:

```
Objective Function:
MAXIMIZE: Meal satisfaction score + Nutritional effectiveness
SUBJECT TO:
- Daily macro targets (equality constraints)
- Protein synthesis windows (inequality constraints)  
- Digestive capacity limits (inequality constraints)
- Workout timing requirements (conditional constraints)
- Meal size preferences (bounded constraints)
```

### Protein Distribution (Advanced)
**Protein Synthesis Optimization:**
- **Minimum effective dose**: 20g per meal for muscle protein synthesis
- **Optimal range**: 25-40g per meal for maximum utilization
- **Upper limit**: 50g per meal (diminishing returns above this)
- **Temporal spacing**: Minimum 3-hour intervals between high-protein meals
- **Post-workout window**: 1.5-2x normal protein within 2 hours post-exercise

**Mathematical Model:**
```
For meal i: Protein_i = Base_protein + Workout_bonus + Activity_multiplier
Where:
- Base_protein = Total_daily_protein / Number_of_meals
- Workout_bonus = IF(post_workout, Base_protein * 0.5, 0)
- Activity_multiplier = Daily_activity_level * 0.1
```

### Carbohydrate Distribution (Advanced)
**Glycogen Optimization Strategy:**
- **Pre-workout**: 0.5-1g carbs per kg body weight 1-2 hours before
- **Post-workout**: 1-1.2g carbs per kg body weight within 30 minutes
- **Evening reduction**: 25-40% fewer carbs 4+ hours before bed
- **Circadian rhythm**: Higher carbs align with cortisol patterns (morning peak)

**Algorithm:**
```
Carb_timing_score = Circadian_factor * Activity_factor * Metabolic_factor
Where:
- Circadian_factor = 1.0 (morning) → 0.6 (evening)
- Activity_factor = 1.5 (pre/post workout) → 0.8 (sedentary periods)
- Metabolic_factor = User insulin sensitivity rating (0.8-1.2)
```

### Fat Distribution (Advanced)
**Hormone Optimization & Satiety:**
- **Morning**: Moderate fat (15-25% of meal calories) for hormone production
- **Pre-workout**: Low fat (<10% of meal calories) for faster digestion
- **Post-workout**: Delayed fat (2+ hours post) to not interfere with nutrients
- **Evening**: Higher fat (25-35% of meal calories) for satiety and sleep hormones

**Satiety Integration:**
```
Fat_allocation = Base_fat * Satiety_need * Digestion_window
Where:
- Satiety_need = 1.2 (long gaps between meals) → 0.8 (frequent meals)
- Digestion_window = 0.7 (pre-workout) → 1.3 (evening relaxation)
```

### Calorie Distribution Patterns
**For 3 meals + 2 snacks:**
- Breakfast: 20-25%
- Lunch: 25-30%
- Dinner: 30-35%
- Snacks: 10-15% each

**For 5 equal meals:**
- Each meal: 20% of total

**For 4 meals:**
- Each meal: 25% of total

- Protein distributed to maintain 18-54g range per meal
- Higher calories allocated to main meals for satiety
```

## Advanced Special Considerations

### Multi-Constraint Optimization
1. **Protein Constraints**: 
   - Minimum: 20g per meal (muscle protein synthesis threshold)
   - Optimal: 25-40g per meal (maximum effectiveness zone)
   - Maximum: 50g per meal (absorption capacity limit)
   - Temporal: 3+ hour spacing for optimal utilization

2. **Workout Timing Integration**:
   - **Pre-workout (1-2h before)**: 0.5-1g carbs/kg bodyweight, 15-25g protein, <10g fat
   - **Post-workout (0-30min)**: 1-1.2g carbs/kg bodyweight, 25-40g protein, minimal fat
   - **Post-workout (30min-2h)**: Continue high protein, moderate carbs, can add fat
   - **Non-workout days**: Even distribution with circadian rhythm consideration

3. **Metabolic Typing**:
   - **Fast oxidizer**: Higher carbs (45-55%), moderate protein (25-30%), lower fat (20-25%)
   - **Slow oxidizer**: Lower carbs (35-45%), higher protein (30-35%), higher fat (25-30%)
   - **Mixed type**: Balanced approach (40-50% carbs, 25-30% protein, 25-30% fat)

4. **Meal Timing Sophistication**:
   - **Circadian rhythm**: Align carb intake with natural cortisol rhythm
   - **Thermic effect**: Larger meals earlier for higher metabolic boost
   - **Sleep optimization**: Lower carbs 3+ hours before bed unless post-workout

5. **Individual Variation Factors**:
   - **Age**: Older adults need higher protein per meal (30-40g vs 20-25g)
   - **Sex**: Women may need more fat for hormone production (25-35% vs 20-30%)
   - **Activity level**: Higher activity = more workout-centric distribution
   - **Metabolic health**: Insulin resistance = lower carb percentage, better timing

## Advanced Error Handling & Constraint Resolution

### Constraint Validation Protocol
```
VALIDATION_SEQUENCE:
1. Check mathematical feasibility (total macros ÷ meals)
2. Validate biological constraints (absorption limits, timing)
3. Assess practical constraints (meal sizes, user preferences)
4. Generate alternative solutions if violations detected
```

### Error Detection & Resolution

#### Mathematical Impossibility
**Detection**: When macro distribution creates impossible meal requirements
**Resolution Strategy**:
```
IF protein_per_meal > 50g:
    SUGGEST: Increase meal count OR reduce protein target
    CALCULATE: Alternative distributions with 4, 5, 6 meal options
    
IF fat_per_meal < 5g:
    WARNING: Essential fatty acid absorption concerns
    SUGGEST: Reduce carb target OR increase fat target by minimum 10g daily
    
IF any_meal_calories < 200 OR > 800:
    FLAG: Impractical meal sizes
    SUGGEST: Redistribute calories with min 200, max 800 per meal
```

#### Biological Constraint Violations
**Protein Synthesis Windows**:
```
IF meals_within_3h_exceed_2:
    WARNING: Protein synthesis interference possible
    SUGGEST: Extend meal spacing OR reduce protein per meal
    ALTERNATIVE: Redistribute protein to fewer, larger doses
```

**Workout Timing Conflicts**:
```
IF pre_workout_fat > 15g:
    WARNING: May cause digestive issues during exercise
    ADJUSTMENT: Redistribute fat to post-workout meals
    
IF post_workout_delay > 2h:
    WARNING: Missing optimal recovery window
    SUGGESTION: Add immediate post-workout snack (25g protein, 30g carbs)
```

#### Practical Feasibility Issues
**Meal Size Extremes**:
```
IF meal_calories < 200:
    CLASSIFY: Snack-sized meal
    SUGGEST: Combine with adjacent meal OR add healthy fats
    
IF meal_calories > 800:
    CLASSIFY: Feast-sized meal  
    SUGGEST: Split into two smaller meals OR reduce portion sizes
```

### Alternative Solution Generation
When primary distribution fails, generate ranked alternatives:

```
ALTERNATIVE_RANKING_ALGORITHM:
1. **Minimal Adjustment**: Smallest change to meet constraints
   - Score = 1 / (sum of constraint violations)
   
2. **Meal Count Modification**: Adjust number of meals
   - Score = effectiveness / disruption_to_routine
   
3. **Target Adjustment**: Modify daily macro targets
   - Score = health_goal_maintenance / target_deviation
   
4. **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine multiple strategies
   - Score = weighted_sum(individual_strategy_scores)

OUTPUT: Top 3 ranked alternatives with trade-off explanations
```

### User Communication Protocol
**Clear Explanation Format**:
```
### Constraint Conflict Detected
**Issue**: [Plain English description]
**Why This Matters**: [Health/practical implications]
**Your Options**:
1. **Easiest Fix**: [Minimal change solution]
2. **Most Effective**: [Optimal solution requiring more change]  
3. **Compromise**: [Middle-ground solution]

**Recommendation**: [Best option with reasoning]
```

**Example Output**:
```
### Constraint Conflict Detected
**Issue**: Your 180g daily protein target requires 45g per meal with 4 meals, but optimal absorption is limited to 40g per meal.

**Why This Matters**: Protein above 40g per meal may not be fully utilized and could cause digestive discomfort.

**Your Options**:
1. **Easiest Fix**: Reduce protein target to 160g (40g per meal)
2. **Most Effective**: Add a 5th meal/snack (36g per meal average)
3. **Compromise**: Keep 180g but accept 10% may not be optimally used

**Recommendation**: Add a 5th meal because it maintains your protein goals while optimizing absorption and won't cause digestive issues.
