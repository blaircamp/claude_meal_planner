# Dietary Restriction Analyzer

**MISSION**: Analyze dietary restrictions and create comprehensive constraints for safe recipe generation.

## Input Parameters
- List of dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free)
- List of allergies (e.g., peanut, tree nut, shellfish)
- Intolerances (e.g., lactose intolerance)
- Dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, paleo)
- Religious restrictions (e.g., halal, kosher)

## Analysis Components

### 1. Restriction Categories

**Allergen-Based:**
- Peanuts → All peanut products, peanut oil, peanut flour

**Diet-Based:**
- Vegan → All animal products
- Vegetarian → Meat, poultry, fish
- Paleo → Grains, legumes, dairy, processed foods
- Keto → High-carb foods, grains, most fruits

**Medical:**
- Celiac → All gluten sources and cross-contamination risks
- Lactose intolerance → Dairy products (except aged cheeses)
- FODMAPs → Specific fruits, vegetables, grains

### 2. Hidden Sources Database

**Gluten Hidden Sources:**
- Soy sauce (use tamari instead)
- Salad dressings
- Processed meats
- Oats (unless certified GF)
- Malt vinegar

### 3. Safe Substitutions

**Dairy Substitutes:**

- Cheese → Nutritional yeast, cashew cheese
- Yogurt → Coconut yogurt, almond yogurt

**Gluten Substitutes:**
- Wheat flour → Almond, coconut, rice, cassava flour
- Pasta → Rice, quinoa, chickpea pasta

- Soy sauce → Tamari, coconut aminos

**Egg Substitutes:**
- Binding → Flax eggs, chia eggs, applesauce
- Leavening → Baking soda + vinegar
- Moisture → Mashed banana, yogurt alternatives
