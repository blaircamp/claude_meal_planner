## Batch Cooking Strategies

### Protein Batching:
- Cook all same proteins together
- Season portions differently for variety
- Cool completely before storing

### Vegetable Prep:
- Wash all produce at once
- Chop similar cuts together
- Blanch vegetables that will be reheated
- Keep raw veggies separate for freshness

### Grain Optimization:
- Cook all grains in bulk
- Slightly undercook for reheating
- Cool completely to prevent sogginess
- Portion while warm for easy separation

### Efficiency Tips:
1. **One-Pan Methods**: Roast proteins and vegetables together
2. **Parallel Cooking**: Use oven, stovetop, and slow cooker simultaneously
3. **Prep Stations**: Set up cutting, seasoning, and portioning stations
4. **Clean as You Go**: Wash dishes during cooking downtime

**Remember**: Focus on practical efficiency that saves time without sacrificing food quality.
